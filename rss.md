The company is also investigating additional mineralisation further beneath the known limits of palaeochannels that underpin the project's exploration strategy.</p><p>The results, Elevate Uranium managing director Murray Hill says, could potentially mean Elevate Uranium updates its Namibian uranium mineral resource estimates up from 20.3Mlb yet again later this year. </p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/7k9Ts9lvp8njdNhByaA2Cs/4020da0114d88686092a459f5f937768/image.png" alt="A map detailing the location of Elevate Uranium&#039;s Koppies target "/><p>A map detailing the location of Elevate Uranium's Koppies target </p><p>Company eyeing new East Koppies mineralised area</p><p>Changes in drilling strategy in the March-April program that targeted the banks of known palaeochannel led to the company finding evidence for an additional flat-lying uranium deposit some 1.6km east of the main Koppies project target. </p><p>Elevate Uranium suspects the body extends 1km in a northeast-southwest direction at some 400m width; open to the SW and to the NE, between 2m and 16m depth. </p><p>Elevate Uranium notes this is unique in its Erongo district project area and is likely hosted in metasedimentary rock. </p><p>This flat lying body has not been included in the updated resource estimates and may provide a bet of confidence in the company's ability to upgrade its resource further in the relatively near future. </p><p>Consistent mineralisation adjacent to Deep Yellow tenement  </p><p>Elevate Uranium's mineral resource, located in the Koppies target, shares its western border with tenements owned by <a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/dyl" title="">Deep Yellow (ASX:DYL)</a>, part of the latter's Tumas project. </p><p>Elevate's final inferred mineral resource estimate includes a number of cut-off grades from 50 parts per million (ppm) to 200ppm U3O8. Uranium minerals on-site the Koppies project are limited to Uranium vanadates, with carnotite the most common encountered. </p><p>The geology of the area is well understood on the back of fifty years of local exploration, and 30km to the north is located the Langer Heinrich uranium mine 75% owned by Paladin Energy and shared with a division of a state-owned Chinese nuclear player CNNC Overseas Uranium Holdings. </p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/4eQ3JqQT1nCuo3rg8GhaO1/f16c305c03801872478d9e83a44a2318/image.png" alt="Elevate Uranium&#039;s (ASX:EL8) charts over the last six months"/><p>Elevate Uranium's (ASX:EL8) charts over the last six months</p> </description>

<title>Every 5.5 BHP shares gets you one Woodside, but don’t forget the absolute gift horse: Fully franked credits </title>
<link>https://www.marketindex.com.au/news/every-5-5-bhp-shares-gets-you-one-woodside-but-dont-forget-the-absolute-gift</link>

These shares are the proceeds of BHP spinning off its petroleum assets, hence owning 48% of the merged group.</p><p>Absolute gift</p><p>If you’re an SMSF or retiree who has struggled to get a decent return on record low term deposits in recent years, BHP’s 5.5 for 1 in specie distribution also offers an absolute gift of additional income generation. </p><p>That’s because BHP’s cleverly constructed in specie dividend – as opposed to paying cash - also allows low-tax or zero-tax investors to earn additional income due to fully franked credits.</p><p>Based on back-of-the-envelope guestimates, the dividend amount – a la Woodside shares – would according to one fund manager estimate (mid-April) represent around US$4.60 – or 12% of BHP’s share price – which would carry US$1.97 of franking credits per BHP share.</p><p>Blind selling</p><p>Gaurav Sodhi of Intelligent Investor suspects a possible side-effect of institutional investors waking up with a holding in Woodside shares - they neither want nor asked for - could lead to some blind selling. </p><p>This eventuality, adds Sodhi, could lead to some downward pressure of the Woodside share price.</p><p>What’s clearly weighing on the minds of institutional investors, adds Sodhi is a potential environmental, social, and governance (ESG) overhang weighing on Woodside’s capex decisions. </p><p>Taking good returns and investing in clean energy alternatives, like hydrogen – with uncertain financial outcomes - to keep institutional investors happy, notes Sodhi is something the market is currently struggling with. </p><p>“Given the price of oil (US$103.40) Woodside’s share price should be trading in the $40s, so it clearly looks as if capex and other issues are weighing heavily on the stock,” Sodhi notes.</p><p>Post-merger</p><p>BHP will have received 914.8m newly issued Woodside Shares at completion.</p><p>Woodside will retain its primary listing on the ASX and is seeking a standard listing on the LSE and a sponsored Level III ADR program on the NYSE from completion of the merger.</p><p>A share sale facility will be in place for eligible small BHP shareholders – with less than 1000 shares - who elect to participate, and for shareholders who are ineligible to receive Woodside shares.</p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/7i2v4O9K9HCvJ1PzmyxAba/de66516c9e2fe1899f1034938397a49d/image.png" alt="image"/><p>Woodside share price: A 12-month snapshot.</p> </description>

The company said it had no new capacity coming online this year, and all the upside was coming from pricing. </p><p>The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it will provide US$3.1bn in funding to support efforts to make EV batteries and components in the US. Separately, the Department of Energy said an additional US$60m will be available to support the reuse and recycling of used EV batteries.</p><p>The ETF is in a rather fragile position, previously slicing through key support areas like the 200-day and $96 level (red band) with ease. Until the ETF can reclaim such support areas, small green days shouldn't be taken too seriously. </p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/5elfKCP41mo14L3QkGx3av/6556d9a3c2e8a985cc27781c2dc09201/2022-05-04_08_06_50-REMX_2022-05-04_08-06-46.png_-_Photos.png" alt="2022-05-04 08 06 50-REMX 2022-05-04 08-06-46.png ‎- Photos"/><p>Source: TradingView, Annotations by Market Index</p><p>Nevertheless, the small overnight bounce could see some positive flow for local names. </p><p>#2 Energy</p><p>OPEC+ is due to meet on Thursday to discuss oil output.

with total broadband services up 11% quarter-on-quarter or 47% year-on-year in the residential broadband segment -management advised of media buyer concerns that marketing efficiency would take a hit during the federal election.</p><p>As well as downgrading the top end of its earnings and active broadband connections guidance ranges for FY 2022, other headwinds include its Connectivity Virtual Circuit (CVC) expense, which more than doubled quarter-on-quarter to $4.9m from $1.8m.</p><p>While a rise was always on the cards, the increase was 18% greater than originally expected. </p><p>Rapid Growth</p><p>Up 35.76% over one year, the company’s share price has jumped from $4.15 late January to a high of around $6.03 late April, only end up back where it started.</p><p>Based on the underlying strength of the most recent update, this sell-down appears harsh.</p><p>Despite recent share market jitters, the stock has since listing a little more than a year ago, progressed from being unprofitable – with a 3.5% market share of NBN connections -

Price target falls to $5.10 from $5.65 on reduced forecasts.</p> </description>
